                        <p>Hi! My name is Josh Fr&eacute;chette amd I'm a student in the University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp. 
                            I am looking to become a full-stack web developer, though I haven't decided which field I wish to pursue yet. I am currently working part time as a 
                            freelance graphic designer and as a bartender/server.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am a high school graduate of a visual arts program at &Eacute;.S.P. De La Salle in Ottawa, ON and pursued part-time studies at 
                            the Ottawa School of Art and Carleton Unversity afterwards. In 2008, I began the Graphic Design program at OCADU and graduated in 2012, with honours.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In my free time I like to read, walk around the city, and watch movies. I also enjoy biking, snowboarding, camping, hiking, and basketball.
                        </p>
